## 3. Authorized Use Requirements

When using Siyarix for permitted security testing, you must adhere to the following requirements:

1. **Written Authorization**: Always obtain explicit written permission from the system owner before testing any system you do not own. Retain this authorization for the duration of your engagement.

2. **Scope Boundaries**: Do not exceed the authorized scope of testing engagements. Any discovered assets outside scope must be reported without further investigation.

3. **Data Handling**: Securely handle, minimize collection of, and promptly destroy any data collected during testing. Apply the principle of data minimization.

4. **Responsible Reporting**: Report security findings to system owners in a timely, clear, and responsible manner. Provide actionable remediation guidance.

5. **Least Privilege**: Use the minimum access level, tooling, and techniques necessary to accomplish the authorized objective.

6. **Risk Assessment**: Assess the potential impact of testing activities before execution. Implement safeguards to prevent service disruption.

7. **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of authorization, scope, methodology, findings, and data handling procedures for each engagement.
